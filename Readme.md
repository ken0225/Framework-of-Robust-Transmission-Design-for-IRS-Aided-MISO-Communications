This is a code package is related to the follow scientific article:

## G. Zhou, C. Pan, H. Ren, K. Wang and A. Nallanathan, "[A Framework of Robust Transmission Design for IRS-Aided MISO Communications With Imperfect Cascaded Channels](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9180053)," in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 68, pp. 5092-5106, 2020

### If you in any way use this code for research that results in publications, please cite the original article listed above.

All the Matlab code is just for reference, so that readers can understand the algorithms used
in our papers. Install the MOSEK tool before running the supplied code.
File folder “ 2020TSP ” contains the Matlab code of the “WORST-CASE ROBUST
BEAMFORMING DESIGN” in Journal “TSP2020-A Framework of Robust Transmission Design
for IRS-aided MISO communications with imperfect cascaded channels”. Since the Matlab
code of the “OUTAGE CONSTRAINED ROBUST BEAMFORMING DESIGN” in TSP2020 is not in
hand, we recommend the following two pieces of code for interested readers.

1. File folder “Globecom2020” is the Matlab code of the Conference “Globecom2020-
Outage Constrained Transmission Design for IRS-aided Communications with Imperfect
Cascaded Channels”. The only difference between Globecom2020 and TSP2020 is that
the passive beamforming e is designed by using SDR method in Globecom2020 and by
using PCCP method in 2020TSP.

2. File folder “WCL2020” is the Matlab code of the Journal “WCL2020-Robust Beamforming
Design for Intelligent Reflecting Surface aided MISO communication systems”. In
WCL2020, the passive beamforming e is designed by using PCCP method.
